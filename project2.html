      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        In the eCitadel Cyber Challenge, I worked primarily on the Windows Server 2022 machine
        named headman, which served as the Active Directory Domain Controller and hosted a scored
        DNS service. The goal was to investigate an active security incident, remove malicious
        activity, and harden systems while keeping critical services available.

        <li>Configured Windows audit logging to restore visibility into authentication and system activity.</li>
